TODO:
    -Make website GUI for testing.
    -Find out what the proper way to do inheritance without classes is. Can I do with module pattern?
    -Can I use the same clock/read/write functions for every module?

GENERAL:
    -Make sure order of load/enable does not cause any problems.
    -Make sure same size array is always passed between modules.

CLOCK:
    -HIGH and LOW clock cycles
    -Computer components first enable, then load to ensure proper exchange of information.

BUS:
    -Simple array holding and transfering data. Modules can read and write from bus on each clock tick.
    -Bus imput must be bitsize of computer.
